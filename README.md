# Credit Risk Rate Analysis 📊

This repository contains a comprehensive **Credit Risk Analysis** project designed to evaluate loan default risk, borrower behavior, and overall portfolio health using data-driven insights.

The analysis transforms raw loan and customer data into an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that supports smarter credit decisions, risk mitigation, and financial planning.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Assess **default risk levels** across borrower profiles
- Understand how **interest rates, income, and loan amount** influence defaults
- Identify **high-risk segments** within the loan portfolio
- Support data-driven **credit approval and risk management strategies**

## 📊 Key Metrics Overview

- **Total Loan Amount:** $312.43M  
- **Total Loans Issued:** 32,581  
- **Default Rate:** 22%  
- **Total Defaults:** 7,108  
- **Default Risk Exposure:** $77.13M  
- **Recovering Amount:** $26.99M  
- **Expected Loss:** $50.13M  
- **Average Interest Rate:** 11.01%  

## 🔍 Key Insights Uncovered

### Credit Risk & Defaults
- Loan defaults account for **22% of issued loans**, representing significant risk exposure.
- Higher interest rates are associated with increased default probability.
- Certain **loan grades (D–G)** show consistently higher default rates.

### Borrower Characteristics
- Defaults are more common among borrowers with:
  - Shorter employment length
  - Lower income brackets
  - Prior default history on file
- Income level strongly influences default likelihood and loan sustainability.

### Loan Structure
- Larger loan amounts show higher risk concentration.
- Longer loan terms (36–60 months) are linked with increased default exposure.

## 🌍 Segmentation Analysis
The dashboard enables analysis by:
- Loan grade (A–G)
- Income level
- Employment length
- Loan intention
- Gender and marital status
- Loan amount ranges
- Interest rate bands

This segmentation helps identify **high-risk borrower groups** and areas requiring tighter lending controls.

## 📈 Outcome of the Analysis

This project delivers actionable insights that can help:
- Improve credit approval policies
- Reduce default rates
- Optimize interest rate pricing
- Strengthen loan recovery strategies
- Monitor portfolio risk in real time

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- Apply stricter screening for high-risk loan grades
- Adjust interest rates to better reflect borrower risk
- Monitor borrowers with previous default history closely
- Limit high loan amounts for low-income segments
- Strengthen recovery strategies to reduce expected losses
